# WheretoPark?

## PROJECT  1 :  INTERACTIVE FRONTEND PROGRAMMING

This Website is built to allow drivers to quickly find available carparks and find out the carpark rates for them. 
Popular places like hotels, singapore attractions and the buzzling orchard road are available as quick filter for users to view the carpark rates. 
It aims to aid drivers in planning their journey. 

## SCOPE
The website plans to have the following features.

_Basic_
- Display the map
- Limit carpark rates markets to Singapore Attractions, Hotels, Orchard Road vicinity
- Display the various carparks availability status for different vehicle types
- Display carpark rates as overlay over the carpark availability
- Clear all overlay display with a click

_Intermediate (coming soon...)_
- Filter the carpark availability based on vehicle type
- Allow user to input the destination so that he can plan ahead for his journey
- Allow user to chose the desired carpark to go to & plot the route to the carpark chosen

_Advance (current version will not have any development for this level)_
- Allow user to store the favorite carpark as part of their database
- Get the current location of the user

## UX
My Considerations for the website:
User : 
- Drivers

Considerations :  
- Drivers heading to town or attractions will tend to plan their journey ahead of time, hence a website that not only provides the carpark rates but also the availability will be really beneficial 
- Most users will be using the mobile website to access the page.

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap
4. Javascript

## Features
This site orientate around the use of leaflet and use of bootstrap html features.

My Design of the site:
- Simple and quick 
- Predefined filter option with the use of radio buttons allow users to filter the carpark rates with a single click.
- Each selection will change the user display on the map immediately
- Clicking on the car park rate markers will show: 
    - Carpark Name
    - Region 
    - Weekday Rates
    - Saturday Rates
    - Sunday/PH rates
- Clicking on the carpark availability will display the following:
    - Type of vehicle lots (Car lots, Lorry lots, Trailer Lots, Motor Lots)
    - Number of lots available


_Limitations: 

_Errors in console is due to the limit set by oneMap.sg, does not affect the function of the site_

_Features Left to Implement_
_- Allow user to search the designated location and return the nearest carpark _
_- A route to the searched carpark from user's current location

## Testing
Manual Testing is done to ensure that the all functions are functional.
